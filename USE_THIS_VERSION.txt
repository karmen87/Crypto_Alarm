🔧 IMPORTANT: Use the FIXED version!

The main issue was that adding trading pairs was blocking the WebSocket connection for 5-10 seconds, causing disconnections.

✅ USE THIS FILE:
    python app_fixed.py

❌ DON'T USE:
    python app.py  (old version with timeout issues)

---

WHAT WAS FIXED:

1. ✅ Async asset loading - adding pairs no longer blocks the WebSocket
2. ✅ Better WebSocket timeout settings (60 second ping timeout)
3. ✅ Immediate feedback when adding pairs ("Please wait 5-10 seconds...")
4. ✅ Threading mode for better concurrency

HOW TO USE:

1. Pull the latest code:
   git pull origin main

2. Activate virtual environment:
   Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

3. Run the FIXED version:
   python app_fixed.py

4. Open browser:
   http://localhost:5000

5. Add a pair (e.g., BTCUSDT):
   - You'll see "Fetching data... Please wait 5-10 seconds"
   - The connection will stay active
   - After 5-10 seconds, the pair will appear

6. Wait 10 seconds before adding another pair!

---

WHY IT TAKES 5-10 SECONDS:

CoinGecko's free API requires:
- 2 second delay between each API call
- Adding a pair makes 2-3 API calls
- Total time: 4-10 seconds

This is normal and expected with the free API!
